		      --- Category Table ---
		    
The category table serves to define and lay out each category
of the bookmark collection. 
	      
Rules:

	1. Each category entry row in the category table rep-
	   resents one category.
	   
Layout:

	id]name]type]auth
		.
		.
		.
	id]name]type]auth

Definitions:

	      id = unique sequential category ID number (C###)
	    name = name of the category
	    type = r)oot or b)ranch (see category tree table below)
	    auth = auth level user must be to view category
	    
Example:

	C001]Computer]R]~
	C002]Software]B]~
	C003]Hardware]B]~
	
Screen Layout:

		 CATEGORY UPDATE

	Number Name	   Type    Auth Level
	------ ----------- ------- ----------
  [ ]   C001   Computer    ROOT        ?
  [ ]   C002   Software    BRANCH      ?
  [ ]   C003   Hardware    BRANCH      ?
  [*]   C004   [         ] [    V] [       V]
  
		[UPDATE] [REMOVE]
			
  Clicking the UPDATE button when entering in a new category
  will cause the system to validate data entered, and if
  valid, will add the data to the list and redisplay the list.
  
  If the UPDATE button is clicked when a current category is
  selected, the following display is shown to allow the user
  to modify a current category's information:
  
  	Number: C001
	  Name: [Computer        ]
	  Type: [ROOT   V]
    Auth Level: [          V]
    
			 [SAVE] [CANCEL]
			 
  Clicking save will save the changes, while clicking cancel
  will return the user to the update screen without saving any
  changes.
  

		    --- Category Tree Table ---

The purpose of this table is to lay out and establish a category
"tree", which defines the way the individual categories relate to
each other, as well as which links (described below) are part of
which categories in the tree.

Rules:

	1. Each entry in the table describes one path to one link.
	
	2. Multiple links on a path require multiple entries.
	
	3. Categories of type "root" may be listed in tree table as
	   a branch. However, categories of type "branch" may NEVER
	   be listed in tree table as a root.

Layout:

	root]branch]branch]...]link
		.
		.
		.
	root]branch]branch]...]link

Definitions:

	root = root level category ID
      branch = branch level category ID
        link = link ID
		
Example:

	Categories -
	
		C001=Computer
		C002=Software
		C003=Hardware
		
	     Links -

		L001=Encryption Research
		L002=Linux Place
		L003=Computer Cases
		
	      Real -
	      
	        Computer
			Software
				Encryption Research
			        Linux Place
			Hardware
				Encryption Research
				Computer Cases

	     Table -
	     
		C001]C002]L001
		C001]C002]L002
		C001]C003]L001
		C001]C003]L003

Screen Layout:

	Screen layout for the update of this table is as follows:

	1. Main update screen shows all root categories as defined
	   in category table. Beside each root category entry will
	   be a button reading "DEFINE". Clicking on the button
	   will allow the user to update/add branches for that
	   category:
	   
		Computers [DEFINE]
		Science   [DEFINE]
		Society   [DEFINE]
		.
		.
		.
		etc.
		
	2. The branch update screen will allow the user to add
	   and remove branch category(s) to the root category, as
	   well as define links for a branch:
	   
	   	Computers:
			Software [DEFINE] [REMOVE]
			Hardware [DEFINE] [REMOVE]
			Link [UPDATE] [REMOVE] [COPY]
			
			[Category Dropdown] [ADD BRANCH]

			[ADD LINK] [PASTE LINK]

	3. Clicking on the DEFINE button allows the user to
	   continue adding or updating further branches under
	   the current branch or root (see below). Clicking
	   the REMOVE button will remove the branch (and sub-
	   branches) from the current branch or root.
	   
	   Links may be updated by clicking the UPDATE button
	   next to the link. The link information will display
	   in the screen defined in the link table section
	   below. A link may also be removed from the current
	   branch or root by clicking the REMOVE button next
	   to the link. Links may also be "copied" to allow
	   them to be pasted under other paths in the tree
	   (the PASTE LINK button will only be available if
	   the user has clicked on the COPY button previous-
	   ly). Clicking the ADD LINK button will allow the
	   user to add a link using the screen defined in the
	   link table section below.
	   
	   Branches may be added to the current branch or
	   root by selecting the category from the dropdown
	   and clicking the ADD BRANCH button.
	   
	   An example of a multiple branch path (that is, a
	   path which starts from a root category, branches,
	   then sub-branches) is as follows:
	   
	   	Computers:
			Software:
				Games [DEFINE] [REMOVE]
				Apps [DEFINE] [REMOVE]
				Link [UPDATE] [REMOVE] [COPY]
				
				[Category Dropdown] [ADD BRANCH]
				
				[ADD LINK] [PASTE LINK]
				
	   As can be seen, this is simply an extension of the 
	   previous display.
	   
	4. Roots, branches and links will be displayed as color
	   coded nodes in the list. In addition, links may be
	   "browsed" from the list by clicking on them at any
	   time.


			--- Link Table ---

The link table serves to define and lay out the individual links
within the bookmark collection, as referenced in the category
tree table (see above).

Rules:

	1. Each link entry row in the link table represents
	   one link.

Layout:

	id]link]name]description]auth
		.
		.
		.
	id]link]name]description]auth

Definitions:

	      id = unique sequential link ID number (L######)
	    link = http reference
	    name = name to be displayed for the <a href>
     description = description of the link
	    auth = auth level user must be to view link

Example:

	L001]www.encryption.org]Encryption Research]All things encryption]~
	L002]www.linux.org]Linux Place]All about Linux]~
	L003]www.computercase.com]Computer Cases]Low cost cases for PCs]~

Screen Layout:

			   LINK UPDATE

	Number: L001
	  Link: [www.encryption.org         ]
	  Name: [Encryption Research        ]
	  Desc: [All things encryption                       ]
    Auth Level: [          V]

			 [SAVE] [CANCEL]
			 
  Clicking save will save the changes, while clicking cancel
  will return the user to the category tree list without saving
  any changes.
