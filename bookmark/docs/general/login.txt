Login and Session Security Checking:

1. Check session ID:

	a. If not null, matches DB, remote IP matches DB: Goto Main.
	b. If not null, doesn't match DB or remote IP doesn't match DB:
	   Disable the account, show message, and log out.
	c. If null: Goto (Login) step 2a.
	
2. Login:

	a. Display and obtain login/password.
	b. If login and password match DB: Set IP on DB to remote IP and 
	   assign session number. Store session number in DB. Goto Main.
	b. If login and password do not match: Increment fail count on DB.
	   Goto (Login) step 2a.
	c. If fail count > 3: Disable the account, show message, and log out.

3. Main:

The session ID is appended to each link and request. When the link is clicked
to execute another Perl request, the session ID is sent as part of the request.
Each Perl subprogram checks the link against the DB (per steps 1a-1c above),
in order to maintain security integrity.
